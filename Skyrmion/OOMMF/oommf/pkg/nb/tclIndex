# Tcl autoload index file, version 2.0
# This file is generated by the "auto_mkindex" command
# and sourced to set up indexing information for one or
# more commands.  Typically each line is a command that
# sets an element in the auto_index array, where the
# element name is the name of a command and the value is
# a script that loads the command.

# The following lines were appended to this file by the
# command 'Oc_MakeTclIndex' called by pimake .  They
# provide entries in the auto_index array to support the
# auto-loading of Oc_Classes.
