	abstract = {Neuromorphic computing offers energy-efficient computations for large-scale data processing compared to conventional von Neumann computing. The artificial synapse, a key element for learning and memory operations in neuromorphic computing, requires multi-state characteristics and the capability to change and store its states. The implementation of hardware-based artificial synapses using nonvolatile memory provides significant advantages in terms of energy consumption and circuit area compared to their currently employed CMOS-based counterparts. In this regard, spintronic devices have emerged as a promising candidate due to their desirable properties for artificial synapses, including multilevel formability, non-volatility, and outstanding writing performance. In this study, spintronic artificial synapses utilizing voltage-controlled multilevel magnetic states and energy- and area-efficient artificial neural network architectures associated with them are demonstrated. The multilevel states are created by gradually modulating the magnetic easy-axis orientation from perpendicular to in-plane and vice versa, which is achieved either by sequentially applying gate voltage pulses or by adjusting the pulse width of the gate voltage. Based on these spintronic artificial synapses, convolutional neural network (CNN) and spiking neural network (SNN) architectures are constructed, demonstrating high recognition accuracy for the MNIST dataset with improved energy efficiency and a reduced circuit area.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.1607.04596},
	abstract = {The stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski (s-LLGS) equation is widely used to study the temporal evolution of the macrospin subject to spin torque and thermal noise. The numerical simulation of the s-LLGS equation requires an appropriate choice of stochastic calculus and numerical integration scheme. In this paper, we comprehensively evaluate the accuracy and complexity of various numerical techniques to solve the s-LLGS equation. We focus on implicit midpoint, Heun, and Euler-Heun methods that converge to the Stratonovich solution of the s-LLGS equation. By performing numerical tests for both strong (path-wise) and weak (statistical) convergence, we quantify the accuracy of various numerical schemes used to solve the s-LLGS equation. We demonstrate a new method intended to solve Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) with small noise (RK4-Heun), and test its capability to handle the s-LLGS equation. We also discuss the circuit implementation of nanomagnets for large-scale SPICE-based simulations. We evaluate the efficacy of SPICE in handling the stochastic dynamics of the multiplicative noise in the s-LLGS equation. Numerical schemes such as Euler and Gear, typically used by SPICE-based circuit simulators do not yield the expected outcome when solving the Stratonovich s-LLGS equation. While the trapezoidal method in SPICE does solve for the Stratonovich solution, its accuracy is limited by the minimum time step of integration in SPICE. We implement the s-LLGS equation in both its cartesian and spherical coordinates form in SPICE and compare the stability and accuracy of the two implementations. The results in this paper will serve as guidelines for researchers to understand the tradeoffs between accuracy and complexity of various numerical methods and the choice of appropriate calculus to solve the s-LLGS equation.},

First, the Ginzburg–Landau theory of chiral magnets is shown to include an important contribution from the Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya interaction that results in a ground state with a spiral spin configuration. This spiral spin state was predicted to undergo a phase transition to the skyrmion crystal phase under the application of a magnetic field of sufficient strength. This prediction was later realized in the A-phase of MnSi and was soon found to be an ubiquitous phase in thin-film chiral ferromagnets. In addition to the standard Ginzburg–Landau analysis, modern approaches to skyrmion crystal phase such as classical Monte Carlo simulation and CP\$\${\textasciicircum}1\$\$theory are discussed.},

	abstract = {Solitonic magnetic excitations such as domain walls and, specifically, skyrmionics enable the possibility of compact, high density, ultrafast, all-electronic, low-energy devices, which is the basis for the emerging area of skyrmionics. The topological winding of skyrmion spins affects their overall lifetime, energetics, and dynamical behavior. In this Perspective, we discuss skyrmionics in the context of the present-day solid-state memory landscape and show how their size, stability, and mobility can be controlled by material engineering, as well as how they can be nucleated and detected. Ferrimagnets near their compensation points are promising candidates for this application, leading to a detailed exploration of amorphous CoGd as well as the study of emergent materials such as     Mn 4  N and inverse Heusler alloys. Along with material properties, geometrical parameters such as film thickness, defect density, and notches can be used to tune skyrmion properties, such as their size and stability. Topology, however, can be a double-edged sword, especially for isolated metastable skyrmions, as it brings stability at the cost of additional damping and deflective Magnus forces compared to domain walls. Skyrmion deformation in response to forces also makes them intrinsically slower than domain walls. We explore potential analog applications of skyrmions, including temporal memory at low density—one skyrmion per racetrack—that capitalizes on their near ballistic current–velocity relation to map temporal data to spatial data and decorrelators for stochastic computing at a higher density that capitalizes on their interactions. We summarize the main challenges of achieving a skyrmionics technology, including maintaining positional stability with very high accuracy and electrical readout, especially for small ferrimagnetic skyrmions, deterministic nucleation, and annihilation and overall integration with digital circuits with the associated circuit overhead.},

Here we show that the current-induced creation, motion, detection and deletion of skyrmions at room temperature can be used to mimic the potentiation and depression behaviours of biological synapses. In particular, the accumulation and dissipation of magnetic skyrmions in ferrimagnetic multilayers can be controlled with electrical pulses to represent the variations in the synaptic weights. Using chip-level simulations, we demonstrate that such artificial synapses based on magnetic skyrmions could be used for neuromorphic computing tasks such as pattern recognition.

The SkL exists over an unusually broad temperature range compared with other bulk crystals and the orientation of the vortices is not controlled by the external magnetic field, but instead confined to the magnetic easy axis.

	abstract = {Neuromorphic computing, inspired by the biological nervous system, has attracted considerable attention. Intensive research has been conducted in this field for developing artificial synapses and neurons, attempting to mimic the behaviors of biological synapses and neurons, which are two basic elements of a human brain. Recently, magnetic skyrmions have been investigated as promising candidates in neuromorphic computing design owing to their topologically protected particle-like behaviors, nanoscale size and low driving current density. In one of our previous studies, a skyrmion-based artificial synapse was proposed, with which both short-term plasticity and long-term potentiation functions have been demonstrated. In this work, we further report on a skyrmion-based artificial neuron by exploiting the tunable current-driven skyrmion motion dynamics, mimicking the leaky-integrate-fire function of a biological neuron. With a simple single-device implementation, this proposed artificial neuron may enable us to build a dense and energy-efficient spiking neuromorphic computing system.},

	abstract = {Ferroelectric transistors (FeFETs) are amongst the most promising candidates for synaptic cross-bar array designs used for in-memory computation (IMC) of matrix-vector multiplications (MVMs) (Fig. 1) in deep neural networks (DNNs). However, FeFETs have several non-ideal attributes such as non-linearities, variations and faults. These, along with circuit non-idealities in the cross-bar array [1], produce output currents that may deviate from the expected (ideal) currents (Fig. 1). This can lead to computation errors, impairing system accuracy. Therefore, FeFETs need to be judiciously designed to minimize the impact of the device-circuit non-idealities on DNN accuracy. While several works have explored the implications of FeFETs in DNNs [2]–[3], analysis on the impact of FE thickness (T$_{\textrm{FE}}$) on system accuracy, accounting for the device-circuit non-idealities is lacking. To that end, we analyze the impact of T$_{\textrm{FE}}$ on the characteristics of FeFET-based synaptic devices based on physical models calibrated to experiments (Fig. 2). We present how T$_{\textrm{FE}}$ scaling affects the IMC of MVMs and DNN accuracy, considering device-circuit non-idealities including variations and faults in FeFETs and wire/sink/driver resistances in the cross-bar array.},

	abstract = {A theory of anisotropic superexchange interaction is developed by extending the Anderson theory of superexchange to include spin-orbit coupling. The antisymmetric spin coupling suggested by Dzialoshinski from purely symmetry grounds and the symmetric pseudodipolar interaction are derived. Their orders of magnitudes are estimated to be (𝛥⁢𝑔𝑔) and (𝛥⁢𝑔𝑔)2 times the isotropic superexchange energy, respectively. Higher order spin couplings are also discussed. As an example of antisymmetric spin coupling the case of CuCl2·2H2O is illustrated. In CuCl2·2H2O, a spin arrangement which is different from one accepted so far is proposed. This antisymmetric interaction is shown to be responsible for weak ferromagnetism in 𝛼-Fe2O3, MnCO3, and CrF3. The paramagnetic susceptibility perpendicular to the trigonal axis is expected to increase very sharply near the Néel temperature as the temperature is lowered, as was actually observed in CrF3.},

	abstract = {Traditional electronic technologies face many challenges, such as the scalability of equipment and improvement of performance. Some novel spintronic objects are expected to improve electronic applications for the more-than-Moore era. For example, a magnetic skyrmion is a potential building block for the next generation of electronic devices due to its small size, good stability and low driving current threshold. However, the Magnus force acting on a ferromagnetic skyrmion can induce a transverse motion perpendicular to the driving force, which may lead to the destruction of skyrmions at sample edges. Here, we computationally demonstrate that the nanotrack edge with high magnetic perpendicular anisotropy (PMA), which is controlled by the voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy (VCMA) effect, not only enables the reliable motion of skyrmions along the nanotrack, but also increases the skyrmion velocity. The one-way motion of skyrmions can be realized by applying voltage to create high PMA at a local area near the nanotrack edge. In addition, we show a feasible design of a skyrmion diode similar to the P–N junction. Our results may provide guidelines for designing skyrmion-based diodes.},

	abstract = {Topological protection precludes a continuous deformation between topologically inequivalent configurations in a continuum. Motivated by this concept, magnetic skyrmions, topologically nontrivial spin textures, are expected to exhibit topological stability, thereby offering a prospect as a nanometer-scale nonvolatile information carrier. In real materials, however, atomic spins are configured as not continuous but discrete distributions, which raises a fundamental question if the topological stability is indeed preserved for real magnetic skyrmions. Answering this question necessitates a direct comparison between topologically nontrivial and trivial spin textures, but the direct comparison in one sample under the same magnetic fields has been challenging. Here we report how to selectively achieve either a skyrmion state or a topologically trivial bubble state in a single specimen and thereby experimentally show how robust the skyrmion structure is in comparison with the bubbles. We demonstrate that topologically nontrivial magnetic skyrmions show longer lifetimes than trivial bubble structures, evidencing the topological stability in a real discrete system. Our work corroborates the physical importance of the topology in the magnetic materials, which has hitherto been suggested by mathematical arguments, providing an important step toward ever-dense and more-stable magnetic devices.},
